## Miscellaneous Security Scripts

This repository is for miscellaneous setup instructions and other security-related files that are not-so-easy-to-find in Ubuntu Cosmic or above. A tutorial to outline each file and their applications will be coming soon. Note: These tools are centric to the Ubuntu tools Apparmor, AuditD, and/or ZoneMinder specifically.
